# Snake-and-Ladders 🐍🪜
> 📌100-square snake and ladder game players, 2-4
Everyone must have played the famous game Snakes and Ladders. Alternatively, through the eyes through the ears Snakes and ladders may be a board game that we are all familiar with.
But wouldn't it be wonderful if we made this game simpler to play? Therefore, specifically for that, our group created this snakes and ladders game. which we've taken our understanding of Python from PSCP class.
Use this project to review and improve your programming knowledge in Python.
Enjoy playing our game ^_^

## 📚General Information
> 📖 Python-based four-player Snake & Ladder game with Pygame as the primary game module. The majority of PyGame's features involve taking mouse input and displaying it on the screen.
As for how the game operates, he designed it himself after researching it from numerous sources.
When a player steps on the snake's head, a question will emerge; if the player properly answers, the question will not descend to the snake's tail. This is an addition to the traditional snake and ladder game. However, if the response is incorrect, it will descend to the snake's tail.
- **`What problems did you face with this project?`**  
There was a small obstruction. For instance, if you forget to write any code, you may quickly inspect and fix it.
- **`What is the purpose of your project?`**  
For developing games for enjoyment and honing Python programming abilities.
- **`Why did you undertake it?`**  
Considering that it is a project, a game that everyone should have played, and the rules are not very complicated and straightforward.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## ⏳Workflow
1. Before beginning the game It will show the game's home page. 
>    * It will show the game play page once you touch the start button.
>    * The game will end if the quit button is pressed.

2. Various UI pages will show as the player accesses the game page, and there will be a Roll dice button to begin rolling the dice.
3. When rolling the dice, push the button.
>    * A 1-6-dice randomization scheme
>    * Include the player's current position in the points total.
  
   The player remains where they are if their score is more than 100.  
   The player moves to the box that contains the total of the two numbers if the point does not exceed 100.
  
4. Verify if the gamer stepped on the snake's head or the ladder.  
      🪜 When ascending stairs positions the player at the top of the ladder.  
      🐍 If treading on a snake's head raises any queries that need to be answered.  
   >    * If the participant responds accurately The same location as the player.  
   >    * If the participant responds wrongly Place the player back at the snake's tail.
      If you never tread on a snake's head or a ladder. The same location as the player.
  
5. Look to see whether there is a winner.  
>    * If a winner is declared Declare the game over and the winner.  
>    * If no one is victorious Rewind to verse 3 now.

## 📝Project Status
Project is : ✅ _complete_


## ⚙Room for Improvement
Include areas of components that, in our opinion need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for Improvement:
- **`Improvement to be done 1`** To make the game more challenging, increase the number of snakes rather than ladders.
- **`Improvement to be done 2`** UI game

To do:
- **`Feature to be added 1`** We want to add a number of players to the game's home page so that people may participate in various scenarios.
- **`Feature to be added 2`** Give different table layouts or allow players to select the amount of dice to add diversity to the game.
